# kismet_timeplot
Tool to plot a timeline of wifi packets captured with kismet

This python script uses *matplotlib* to draw a chart with the activity of each devices (by mac addresses) captured by *kismet*. It draws a timeline for each wifi mac addresses with a marker at the time a packet has been captured.

It opens an interactive *matplotlib* window if no output image is specified.

```
usage: kismet_timeplot.py [-h] [-b DB] [-i [IMAGE]] [-l] [--label]
                          [-k KNOWNMAC] [-M MIN] [-m MAC] [-p] [-r RSSI]
                          [-s START] [--time-span TIME_SPAN] [-t [TITLE]] [-v]

Plot a timeline of devices' activity as captured by kismet

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b DB, --db DB        file name of the kismet db
  -i [IMAGE], --image [IMAGE]
                        output an image
  -l, --legend          add a legend
  --label               add a mac label for each plot
  -k KNOWNMAC, --knownmac KNOWNMAC
                        known mac to highlight in red
  -M MIN, --min MIN     minimum number of packets for device to be plotted
  -m MAC, --mac MAC     only display that mac
  -p, --privacy         merge LAA MAC address
  -r RSSI, --rssi RSSI  minimal value for RSSI
  -s START, --start START
                        start timestamp
  --time-span TIME_SPAN
                        time span (coud be #d or ##h or ###m)
  -t [TITLE], --title [TITLE]
                        add a title to the top of image (if none specified,
                        use a timestamp)
  -v, --verbose         be verbose
```

![Image of chart plotted with kismet_timeplot.py](plot.png)

By default, it plots the last **24 hours**. So if your capture is older than that, you need to specify a start time (with `-s` or `--start`) and possibly a time span (with `--time-span`)
